> ###### Design Choices
> * On the intro page, I have specifically decreased the image transition rate in the image carousel, to subtly show the zebra pattern beneath momentarily between each slide. I felt that vivid and immediate image transitions would break the consistency of the ux and theme.
> * Original layout from wireframe 'felt' different on screen to how I had first imagined it; and as a result, I decided on an alternative layout midway through the project. [Original Wireframe](https://github.com/JimLynx/CI-MS2-Safari-Africa/blob/master/assets/docs/Wireframes.pdf)
